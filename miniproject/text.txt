"Shining Through"

(Verse 1)
Walking through the morning light,
Golden rays are shining bright.
Every step, a brand-new day,
All the dark is washed away.

(Pre-Chorus)
I hear the wind call out my name,
Telling me to rise again.
No more fears, no more chains,
I’m dancing through the pouring rain.

(Chorus)
Oh-oh-oh, I’m shining through,
Breaking walls, I’m born anew.
No more shadows, only light,
I’m soaring high, I’m taking flight.

(Verse 2)
Mountains tall, I used to fear,
Now I climb with strength so clear.
Every dream, I hold so tight,
I won’t back down, I’ll win this fight.

(Bridge)
Even when the nights grow cold,
I’ve got a fire in my soul.
No more doubt, no more pain,
I’ll keep running through the flame.

(Outro)
Oh-oh-oh, I’m shining through,
Breaking walls, I’m born anew.
No more shadows, only light,
I’m soaring high, I’m taking flight.
